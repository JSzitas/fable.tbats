# fable.tbats

fable.tbats is a wrapper around the implementation of **tbats** from the
**forecast** package, to facilitate usage of tbats in the **fable**
framework. Note that this is by no means a reimplementation - and this
is currently not yet tested. Testing is a WIP.

Use at your own risk at this time!

## Installation

Currently only:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("JSzitas/fable.tbats")
```
