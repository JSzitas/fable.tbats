# fable.tbats

fable.tbats is a wrapper around the implementation of **tbats** from the **forecast** package, 
to facilitate usage of tbats in the **fable** framework. Note that this is by no means a reimplementation - 
and this is currently not yet tested. Testing is a WIP. 

Use at your own risk at this time! 

## Installation

Currently only: 

``` r
pak::pkg_install("JSzitas/fable.tbats")
```
